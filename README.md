# towerDefenseTest

A fun little video game in Python. Because unity is slow. Below is the premise! hope y'all like it :)


>It is Christmas Eve, one year since the war.
>
>One year since Santa Claus declared all of North America to be on the naughty list. That night, city after city was destroyed by nuclear hellfire. Humanity retreated in the face of this unstoppable threat, regrouping in the last stronghold, the citadel of Denver. It is the last hope of North America. The last few airbases are on high alert, ready to defend at any moment, at any cost.
>
>It is Christmas Eve. Denver sleeps uneasily under a blackout. Deep under Denver, the remnants of the North Warning System detect the unmistakeable radar signatures: Santa's sleighs are moving again.


## progress log, '25
#### Jul 29 - v0.0.1 'Voodoo'
So far, a lot of the preliminary art is in place. 
So far Santa's sleigh-bombers are spawned via spacebar. 
Clicking on airbases will spawn an interceptor. 
TODO - rework collisions?
TODO - make rotations work better?
TODO - game loop currently doesn't exist. Not really much of a game right now.
