# towerDefenseTest

A fun little video game in Python. Because unity is slow.

## progress log, '25
#### Jul 29 - v0.0.1 'Voodoo'
So far, a lot of the preliminary art is in place. 
So far Santa's sleigh-bombers are spawned via spacebar. 
Clicking on airbases will spawn an interceptor. 
TODO - rework collisions?
TODO - make rotations work better?
TODO - game loop currently doesn't exist. Not really much of a game right now.
