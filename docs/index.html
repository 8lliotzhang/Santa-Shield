        It is Christmas Eve, one year since the war.<br>
        One year since Santa Claus declared all of North America to be on the naughty list. That night, city after city was destroyed by nuclear hellfire.

The last few airbases are on high alert, ready to defend at any moment, at any cost.<br>
